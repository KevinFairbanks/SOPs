# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed and encouraged! Here's how you should contribute to repositories in this organization:

- Contact one of the repository owners to be added as a contributor.
- Open an issue in the repository describing the feature you intend to work on. Ex: "Add support for calling City Representatives".
- Check out a new branch for this feature from the repository's `development` branch. Ex: `git checkout -b call-city-reps`.
- Do your work on that branch.
- When your changes are ready to be merged, open a pull request from your feature branch to the repo's `development` branch.
- In the comments of your Pull Request, point out which issue you've resolved and how.
