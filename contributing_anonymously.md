# Contributing Anonymously

Most of us, if not all of us, have our GitHub profiles attached to our regular lives.
Many of us may not want the connection between that world and this world to be apparent.
This document is for describing how to keep that from happening, if that's what you want.

There are two main options: a detour through a non-GitHub client or creating a new GitHub account for this work.

## Creating a New GitHub Acct

- Set up a dummy email account that cannot be connected to you
- Use that email to sign up for GitHub
- Contact one of the owners of the StayWokeOrg repo to add your alternative account to the member list
- Contribute from that account

## Detour Through non-GitHub Client

- Set up an account on a site that allows for Private Repositories like GitLab or BitBucket
- Do your work in a private repo there
- Notify someone on the public side of your project that your work is done and is ready for them to pull your branch
- When they respond, add them as a collaborator on that site
- The public companion will make a new branch from the project's `development` branch and copy all of your code into that new branch
- They will push that branch up to the GitHub repo and it will then go through the merge process

We all want to do good work, and definitely don't want anyone's life negatively impacted if they're not ready for that load.

Cheers.
