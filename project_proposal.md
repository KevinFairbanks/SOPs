# Proposing and Starting a New Project

We're a very vibrant, motivated group of developers that always have new ideas. Let's make sure that they fit our vision for the organization.
You don't need a lot, but try to fit this basic guideline.

* (Tentative) Project Title <required>
* Short Description <required>
* Anticipated Tech Stack
* Max number of Contributors (e.g. < 10)

Paste these details into the #newprojectproposals slack channel and ask about interest and scope.

After receiving feedback on your project, start a repository in the StayWokeOrg organization with an MIT license and a README.md file that describes the project.
In that README.md file, list out the project originators and the languages used.
It'll be good for new contributors to see what they might be getting themselves into.
Also write out some guidelines for testing, variable naming conventions, etc.

Request a new channel be made in the Slack team for your project. This will facilitate communication between all of the contributors.

Start a `development` branch in that repository. `master` will pull from this branch and this branch only. Any other feature branch should only merge to `development`.
